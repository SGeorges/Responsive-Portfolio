            <p class="bodyText">Hello World! I'm Stefano,</p>
            <br>
            
            <p class="bodyText">
                I'm an aspiring web designer looking to make a start from humble (non-existant) beginnings. After
                going through my developmental years (18-23 for me, late bloomer) under the misconception more difficult
                meant better for me, I came out with a BS in Chemical Engineering at Drexel University. The road was 
                challenging but once I recieved my degree everything worked out well....
            </p>
            <br>

            <p class="bodyText">
                ... is not what happened. In a field where I felt my creativity and freedom where restricted I decided
                to go for broke and change my career pathway to something I personally enjoy. Even though I can't stress 
                how much I loved working outside in the extreme heat or cold, fighting off ticks, chiggers, bees, spiders,
                and not being able to do anything to please my client because the fact they hired me means they're already
                pouring money in an undesired cost, I wanted to do something I could enjoy. 
            </p>

                So here I am. Thanks for checking out my profile!
